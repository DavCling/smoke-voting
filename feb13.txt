Project Idea 1: Wildfire Exposure and Voting Behavior
Question: Does proximity to major wildfires affect people's political participation and voting behavior?
Approach:

Use precinct-level data from California
Source wildfire data from Cal Fire
Focus on precincts on wildfire boundaries (surrounding areas, not directly burned)
Conduct before and after snapshots of treated precincts
Define treated precincts using GIS boundary analysis
Use synthetic control matching of comparison precincts based on characteristics from census tracts and block-level data


Project Idea 2: Facebook Rollout and Political Participation
Question: How does access to social networks (via Facebook) affect political participation in college towns?
Approach:

Use California precinct-level data with shape files
Match to Facebook rollout data (colleges with dates and coordinates)
Define spatial radius around colleges (e.g., one mile)
Identify precincts within radius for elections before and after Facebook introduction
Analyze whether social network access increases political participation
Use college characteristics fromIPEDS as control variables
Focus on having Claude write and debug spatial matching code to create rectangular datasets for econometric analysis


Project Idea 3: Wind Turbine Installation and Voting Behavior
Question: How does establishment of wind turbines affect voting behavior in nearby precincts?
Approach:

Use California precinct-level data
Source wind turbine location and installation dates from federal government
Examine effects on nearby voters, contrasting service workers in surrounding towns with those living on proximate land
Analyze impact on political participation
Identify potential instrumental variables from California and federal legislation
Use prevailing wind maps to assess land suitability for turbines
Explore policy shocks as instruments: policy changes interacted with prevailing winds to identify exogenous variation in turbine location
