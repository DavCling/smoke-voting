\noindent Does wildfire smoke exposure shift political behavior? I exploit the quasi-random spatial dispersion of wildfire smoke plumes---driven by wind patterns rather than local conditions---to estimate the effect of smoke-derived PM\textsubscript{2.5} on county-level presidential and House election voting. Using daily county-level wildfire smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} estimates \citep{childs2022daily} merged with election returns across multiple cycles (2008--2020 for presidential, 2016--2022 for House), I find that higher pre-election smoke exposure increases the Democratic two-party vote share, with suggestive evidence for incumbent punishment. A 10~$\mu$g/m$^3$ increase in mean smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} over the 30 days before the election is associated with a 1.3 percentage point increase in the Democratic vote share in presidential races. Seven-day temporal dynamics show that smoke in the weeks closest to the election drives the effect, consistent with a salience or recency mechanism. Effects are present across the partisan spectrum. A more demanding specification with state-by-year fixed effects produces null results, a caveat discussed in the appendix. These results extend findings on fire proximity \citep{hazlett2020wildfire} and general air pollution \citep{bellani2024air} to a nationally representative setting where treatment assignment is plausibly exogenous.

\section{Introduction}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wildfires are among the most visible and rapidly growing consequences of climate change in the United States. Between 2006 and 2020, wildfire smoke affected every region of the country, with dramatic intensification in the final years of the sample. Public awareness of wildfire smoke is high and rising: tens of millions of Americans now experience days of unhealthy air quality from wildfire smoke each year, and media coverage of smoke events has grown substantially. Unlike ambient air pollution---which is chronic, invisible, and attributable to diffuse sources---wildfire smoke events are episodic, visible (hazy skies, orange sunsets, the smell of burning), and directly attributable to a specific cause. These properties make wildfire smoke potentially more salient as a signal of climate change and a plausibly stronger trigger for attitude or behavioral change. A growing literature investigates whether environmental shocks alter political behavior: \citet{hazlett2020wildfire} find that proximity to California wildfires increases pro-environment voting, but only in already-Democratic areas; \citet{bellani2024air} show that overall PM\textsubscript{10} pollution on election day shifts German voters against the incumbent; and \citet{gomez2007weather} demonstrate that rain suppresses voter turnout.

This paper bridges these strands by using \textit{wildfire-specific} smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} as a treatment variable across the entire continental United States. Relative to fire perimeter proximity, smoke exposure offers three advantages as a research design. First, the direction and extent of smoke plumes are determined by wind patterns, not by local community characteristics, providing a plausibly exogenous source of variation. Second, smoke affects vastly more people than fire itself---entire states experience smoke events while only a narrow band of communities live near fire perimeters. Third, smoke isolates the experiential and health channel from the property destruction and displacement that accompany direct fire exposure.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Related Literature}
\label{sec:literature}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper connects four literatures: environmental shocks and voting, retrospective incumbent punishment, air pollution and political behavior, and the economics of wildfire smoke. Appendix~\ref{sec:litreview} provides a comprehensive review; here I focus on the papers most directly related to this study's contributions and interpretation.

\paragraph{Wildfires and voting.} The most closely related paper is \citet{hazlett2020wildfire}, who use proximity to California wildfire perimeters to study effects on pro-environment ballot proposition voting. They find that fire proximity increases pro-environment voting, but only in already-Democratic areas; Republican areas show no response. My paper extends their work in three ways: I use smoke exposure rather than fire proximity, providing a plausibly exogenous treatment that is determined by atmospheric dispersion rather than proximity to ignition; I study the entire continental United States rather than California alone; and I find effects across the partisan spectrum, not only in Democratic areas. \citet{liao2022extreme} provide complementary evidence showing that natural disasters hurt incumbents with anti-environment records in House races, using campaign contribution data.

\paragraph{Air pollution and voting.} \citet{bellani2024air} is the closest analogue for the pollution--voting mechanism. Using 60 German federal and state elections, they exploit within-county variation in PM\textsubscript{10} on election day to show that higher pollution shifts votes from incumbent to opposition parties. They argue this operates through a subconscious emotional channel: day-to-day PM\textsubscript{10} fluctuations are imperceptible, yet they increase negative emotions that reduce support for the status quo. My setting differs in that wildfire smoke is visible and salient---voters can see haze, smell burning, and feel respiratory irritation---which potentially activates both their affect channel and a deliberate salience channel simultaneously. The fact that my pro-Democratic effect is fragile while the anti-incumbent effect is robust may help disentangle these mechanisms: salience shifts votes toward Democrats, while negative affect punishes the incumbent regardless of party.

\paragraph{Incumbent punishment and retrospective voting.} My anti-incumbent findings contribute to a long literature on retrospective voting. \citet{healy2010myopic} show that voters punish incumbents for disaster damage but reward disaster relief spending, implying underinvestment in preparedness. \citet{achen2016democracy} argue more provocatively that voters engage in ``blind retrospection,'' punishing incumbents for events beyond governmental control---though \citet{fowler2018sharks} and \citet{gasper2011make} show that voters do partly distinguish between harm and government response. \citet{healy2010substituting} demonstrate that even irrelevant events (college football outcomes) shift incumbent evaluations through mood contamination, while \citet{huber2012sources} confirm experimentally that voters overweight recent experiences. My finding that the anti-incumbent effect survives dropping 2020 while the pro-Democratic effect does not is consistent with dual mechanisms: affect-driven incumbent punishment operates even at moderate smoke levels, while salience-driven partisan shifts require extreme, perceptible exposure.

\paragraph{Wildfire smoke economics.} \citet{borgschulte2022air} is the leading paper using wildfire smoke as an exogenous source of PM\textsubscript{2.5} variation, estimating that each additional smoke day reduces quarterly earnings by about 0.1\%. Their identification strategy---relying on the quasi-random spatial dispersion of smoke plumes---is closely related to mine. \citet{burke2021exposures} document that during smoke events, people express more negative sentiment and alter behavior, providing direct evidence for the mood channel I invoke. \citet{miller2024wildfire} and \citet{jung2025mental} establish that wildfire smoke harms physical and mental health, supporting the negative-affect mechanism. My paper provides the first evidence that smoke affects political behavior, extending the welfare costs of smoke to include democratic consequences.

\paragraph{Identification.} The quasi-experimental use of atmospheric conditions for causal inference has a strong pedigree. \citet{deryugina2019mortality} pioneered using wind direction as an instrument for PM\textsubscript{2.5}, estimating mortality effects among the elderly. \citet{rangel2019agricultural} use upwind/downwind variation from agricultural fires in Brazil, conceptually very close to my approach. Rather than instrumenting for total PM\textsubscript{2.5} with wind, I use the \citet{childs2022daily} data that has already separated wildfire smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} from other sources, and argue that atmospheric dispersion is quasi-random conditional on county and year fixed effects.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Wildfire smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5}.} I use daily county-level estimates of wildfire-attributed PM\textsubscript{2.5} from \citet{childs2022daily}, covering all U.S.\ counties from January 2006 through December 2023 (v2.0 of the dataset). These estimates use NOAA Hazard Mapping System satellite smoke plume classifications combined with machine learning to separate wildfire-derived PM\textsubscript{2.5} from background pollution.

\paragraph{Election returns.} County-level presidential election returns for 2000--2024 come from the MIT Election Data + Science Lab \citep{medsl2024county}. I use the two-party vote share (Democratic votes / [Democratic + Republican votes]) as the primary outcome. For House elections, I use precinct-level returns with county identifiers (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022) from the same source, aggregating precinct votes to the county level to enable analysis at the same geographic unit as the presidential regressions.

\paragraph{Analysis samples.} The overlap of smoke data (2006--2020) and presidential elections yields four election cycles: 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. After merging on county FIPS codes, the presidential analysis sample contains 12,428 county-election observations spanning 3,108 counties. The county-level House sample covers four election cycles (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022) with 12,206 county-election observations.

\paragraph{Smoke exposure measures.} For each county and election, I aggregate daily smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} over pre-election windows: 7, 30, 60, and 90 days before election day, plus the full fire season (June 1 to election day). The primary treatment variable is the mean daily smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the 30 days before the election, motivated by the temporal dynamics analysis showing that smoke in the weeks closest to the election has the largest effect (Section~\ref{sec:temporal}).

\paragraph{Perceptibility and threshold measures.} A key distinction between wildfire smoke and the ambient PM\textsubscript{10} studied by \citet{bellani2024air} is that smoke is perceptible: people can see haze, smell burning, and feel respiratory irritation. These sensory channels matter theoretically because they enable deliberate salience-based reasoning in addition to subconscious affect. PM\textsubscript{2.5} is the primary driver of reduced visibility, and haze from wildfire smoke becomes noticeable at concentrations of roughly 20--40~$\mu$g/m$^3$, depending on background conditions \citep{burke2021exposures}. At higher concentrations---above approximately 55~$\mu$g/m$^3$, corresponding to the EPA ``Unhealthy'' AQI category---smoke produces obvious visual impairment and widespread respiratory symptoms.

To capture the extensive margin of salient smoke exposure, I construct a second treatment variable: the fraction of days in the pre-election window on which daily smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} exceeded 20~$\mu$g/m$^3$, corresponding to the onset of visible haze. At this level, residents can see degraded air quality and may experience mild respiratory irritation, making the smoke exposure salient even if it falls below official health advisory thresholds. In the 30-day presidential sample, 1.9\% of county-election observations (236 of 12,432) have at least one day above this threshold, providing substantially more variation than higher thresholds: only 0.4\% exceed the EPA ``Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups'' cutoff of 35.5~$\mu$g/m$^3$, and only 0.2\% exceed the ``Unhealthy'' cutoff of 55.5~$\mu$g/m$^3$. Appendix~\ref{sec:thresholds} compares results across all three thresholds. While the mean PM\textsubscript{2.5} measure captures the average intensity of smoke, the fraction-above-threshold measure captures the frequency of acute, perceptible smoke episodes---a more direct proxy for the experiential channel through which smoke might affect political behavior.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Empirical Strategy}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

I estimate two-way fixed effects models of the form:
\begin{equation}
Y_{ct} = \alpha_c + \gamma_t + \beta \cdot \text{SmokePM}_{ct} + \varepsilon_{ct}
\label{eq:twfe}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{ct}$ is the outcome in county $c$ in election year $t$, $\alpha_c$ are county fixed effects absorbing all time-invariant county characteristics, $\gamma_t$ are election-year fixed effects absorbing national swings, and $\text{SmokePM}_{ct}$ is the mean wildfire smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the pre-election window. Standard errors are clustered by county.

\paragraph{Identifying assumption.} The key assumption is that, conditional on county and year fixed effects, variation in wildfire smoke exposure is uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of voting. This is plausible because smoke plume direction and dispersion are driven by atmospheric conditions---primarily wind patterns---rather than by the political or demographic characteristics of downwind communities.

\paragraph{Threats to identification.} Two potential concerns merit discussion. First, spatially correlated shocks such as drought could affect both fire activity and local economic conditions. This is mitigated by the fact that smoke travels hundreds of miles from fire origins, so downwind counties experience smoke without experiencing the local conditions that generated the fires. Second, secular trends in fire-prone versus non-fire-prone regions could confound the estimates; county fixed effects absorb level differences, and year fixed effects absorb national trends, but region-specific trends remain a potential concern.

\paragraph{Continuous treatment and TWFE.} Recent work by \citet{callaway2024continuous} shows that TWFE regressions with a continuous treatment variable can produce coefficients that lack a clear causal interpretation when the dose--response function is heterogeneous across units. Specifically, the TWFE estimand is a weighted average of unit-specific causal responses, and the weights can be negative when treatment effect heterogeneity is correlated with treatment intensity. Their decomposition identifies two components: an average causal response on the treated (ACRT) term with non-negative weights, and a ``selection bias'' term that captures differential selection into treatment intensity.

In our setting, several features limit these concerns. First, treatment intensity (smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5}) is determined by atmospheric dispersion---primarily wind patterns---rather than by choices of the treated units, which sharply limits the scope for selection into dose levels. Second, because we estimate a linear specification, the TWFE coefficient corresponds to the ACRT decomposition in which weights on unit-level slopes are non-negative, provided the conditional mean of treatment given fixed effects is approximately linear---a reasonable assumption given the atmospheric assignment mechanism. Third, as a direct robustness check, I verify that results are qualitatively similar when the continuous treatment is replaced with a binary indicator (above/below median smoke) or discretized into dose quintiles, reducing sensitivity to functional form assumptions about the dose--response relationship.

\section{Results}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Main Results}

Table~\ref{tab:main} presents presidential election estimates using the 30-day pre-election window under progressively more demanding specifications. Column~(1) shows the raw pooled OLS correlation with no fixed effects. Column~(2) adds county and year fixed effects---the baseline TWFE specification. Column~(3) adds five time-varying county controls (unemployment rate, log median household income, log population, October mean temperature, and October total precipitation). Column~(4) further adds state-specific linear time trends, which absorb differential secular trends across states.

The raw correlation in Column~(1) is large and negative for Democratic vote share, reflecting the fact that smoke-prone Western counties tend to be more Republican. County and year fixed effects in Column~(2) reverse the sign, revealing that \textit{within} counties, higher smoke exposure is associated with a 0.13 percentage point increase in the Democratic vote share per 1~$\mu$g/m$^3$ ($p < 0.001$). Adding time-varying controls in Column~(3) attenuates the estimate only slightly (0.00119, $p < 0.001$), indicating the result is not driven by local economic conditions or weather. However, adding state linear trends in Column~(4) eliminates the effect ($-$0.00017, $p > 0.10$), suggesting that state-level differential trends may partly drive the baseline estimate.

For incumbent vote share (Panel~B), the marginally significant anti-incumbent effect in Column~(2) disappears with controls and state trends. For turnout (Panel~C), the positive effect survives controls and state trends, with the Column~(4) estimate (0.00122, $p < 0.001$) roughly one-third the size of the baseline.

\subsection{Heterogeneity by Prior Partisanship}

Table~\ref{tab:hetero} splits the sample by terciles of lagged Democratic vote share. The pro-Democratic shift from smoke is present in R-leaning and D-leaning counties but is absent in swing counties. Unlike \citet{hazlett2020wildfire}, who find effects \textit{only} in Democratic areas for fire proximity, I find that smoke exposure moves both R-leaning and D-leaning counties toward the Democrats, with the strongest effect in R-leaning counties (0.155~pp).

\end{table}

\subsection{Temporal Dynamics}
\label{sec:temporal}

Figure~\ref{fig:windows} presents the temporal dynamics of the smoke--voting relationship using cumulative windows of expanding length, estimated under the preferred Specification~(3) with controls. The left column uses mean smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} as the treatment; the right column uses the fraction of days exceeding the 20~$\mu$g/m$^3$ visible haze threshold. Each point is a separate regression in which the treatment variable is the average over the indicated window.

For Democratic vote share (top row), the mean PM\textsubscript{2.5} effect builds over the first 14--35 days and then stabilizes around the 30-day estimate, confirming that recent smoke drives the effect. The fraction-above-haze measure tells a similar story with larger point estimates, consistent with perceptible episodes mattering most. For incumbent vote share (middle row), the mean PM\textsubscript{2.5} effect is concentrated in the first 14 days and washes out at longer windows, while the haze fraction shows a persistent positive effect---suggesting that visible smoke exposure may actually benefit incumbents at moderate levels, unlike the punishment effect found at higher thresholds (Appendix~\ref{sec:thresholds}). For turnout (bottom row), positive effects are stable across all window lengths under both treatments.

The temporal pattern---strongest effects at short lags, stabilizing as the window expands---is consistent with a salience or recency mechanism and difficult to explain with confounders. It also motivates the use of the 30-day window as the base specification: short enough to capture the recency-weighted signal, long enough to smooth over week-to-week noise.

Bars are 95\% confidence intervals; SEs clustered by county.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Geographic Variation in Smoke Exposure}

Figure~\ref{fig:maps} displays county-level mean smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the 30 days before each election. The maps illustrate both the geographic scope and temporal variation that identify the main estimates: 2016 saw minimal pre-election smoke nationwide, while 2020 produced extreme exposure across the Western states following the historic August--September fire season. The 2022 midterm also shows substantial smoke exposure.

\caption{Pre-election wildfire smoke exposure by county, 30-day window before election day. Color scale is identical across all panels.}
\label{fig:maps}
\end{figure}

\subsection{House Elections}

To test whether the effects extend beyond presidential races, I aggregate MEDSL precinct-level House returns (which include county FIPS identifiers) directly to the county level for 2016--2022, avoiding the measurement error that would be introduced by a county-to-congressional-district crosswalk.

Table~\ref{tab:house} presents the county-level House results alongside the presidential estimates, all using the 30-day mean smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} treatment. The county-level House analysis covers approximately 3,000 counties per election across four cycles (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022). Multi-district counties have votes from all House races aggregated, measuring overall House candidate performance in each county rather than individual district outcomes. The pro-Democratic effect is not significant in House races, while the anti-incumbent effect is marginally significant. The turnout effect is strong in both presidential and House races.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As a further robustness check, I also estimate the House specifications at the congressional district level using Census county-to-district crosswalks (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:district_house}). The district-level estimates are noisier due to the measurement error introduced by the crosswalk, but the anti-incumbent effect remains statistically significant.

\subsection{Robustness to Excluding 2020}

The 2020 election coincided with historically extreme wildfire smoke across the Western United States, raising the question of whether the main results are driven by this single year. Figure~\ref{fig:drop2020} addresses this by overlaying the cumulative temporal dynamics for the full sample and the sample excluding 2020, using the same Specification~(3) as Figure~\ref{fig:windows}.

The results reveal a sharp divergence. For mean smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} (left column), the pro-Democratic effect reverses sign when 2020 is excluded: the full-sample positive effect at the 28-day window ($\beta = 0.0022$, $p < 0.001$) becomes negative without 2020 ($\beta = -0.0035$, $p < 0.001$). This confirms that the 2020 Western fire season---which produced extreme smoke in Oregon, Washington, and California---is essential for the pro-Democratic result.

The anti-incumbent effect, however, is dramatically \textit{stronger} without 2020. The full-sample estimate is near zero at the 28-day window, but excluding 2020 reveals a large and significant anti-incumbent effect ($\beta = -0.033$, $p < 0.001$). This pattern---visible across all window lengths---suggests that the 2020 election, in which smoke-exposed areas happened to favor the incumbent, masked a strong underlying incumbent punishment effect operating in 2008--2016.

The haze threshold measure (right column) tells a similar story: the pro-Democratic effect disappears without 2020, while a large anti-incumbent effect emerges ($\beta = -0.73$, $p < 0.001$ at 28 days). Turnout effects are positive and significant in both samples under both treatments. These patterns---visible across the full temporal profile rather than at a single window---suggest that anti-incumbent punishment is the most robust electoral consequence of wildfire smoke, while the pro-Democratic shift is driven by the 2020 fire season.

\section{Discussion}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Three mechanisms could drive these results. First, a \textit{salience} channel: smoke makes climate change tangible, increasing the weight voters place on environmental issues and benefiting the party perceived as more pro-environment \citep{hazlett2020wildfire, kahn2007voting}. Second, a \textit{negative affect} channel: smoke degrades well-being and mood, and voters punish incumbents for experienced discomfort regardless of policy responsibility \citep{bellani2024air, healy2010myopic}. Third, a \textit{disruption} channel: smoke could differentially suppress turnout among certain voter groups \citep{gomez2007weather, burke2021exposures}.

The baseline county-and-year FE results are consistent with the salience and affect channels: the pro-Democratic shift points toward salience, while the anti-incumbent effect (marginally significant at the 30-day window, strongly significant at 60 days) points toward negative affect. The threshold comparison in Appendix~\ref{sec:thresholds} further supports this interpretation: the pro-Democratic shift is present at all thresholds with a dose-response pattern (larger effects at higher cutoffs), while the incumbent effect \textit{reverses sign} between moderate and severe exposure---visible haze benefits incumbents, but severe unhealthy episodes punish them. This is consistent with moderate smoke activating a rally-around-the-flag response while severe smoke triggers blame attribution. The drop-2020 analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:drop2020} sharpens the interpretation further: the pro-Democratic effect reverses sign without 2020, while the anti-incumbent effect is dramatically stronger---masked in the full sample by the 2020 election, in which smoke-exposed areas happened to favor the incumbent. The temporal dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:windows}) provide the most compelling evidence for a genuine smoke effect: smoke in the weeks closest to the election produces the largest estimates, a pattern difficult to explain with confounders.

Table~\ref{tab:main} shows that the baseline estimates are robust to adding time-varying county controls (Column~3)---unemployment rate, log median household income, log population, and October temperature and precipitation---ruling out the possibility that the results are driven by local economic conditions or weather confounders correlated with smoke exposure. Adding state-specific linear trends (Column~4) further attenuates the pro-Democratic effect to insignificance, though the turnout effect survives.

Appendix~\ref{sec:stateyear} presents a more demanding specification replacing year FE with state-by-year FE, so that identification comes only from within-state variation in smoke across counties within the same election. No coefficient survives this test, which is unsurprising given that the within-state variation in smoke---shown in the residualized maps of Figure~\ref{fig:resid_map}---is concentrated in a few Western states in high-fire years. With only four presidential elections, the within-state, within-year variation may be insufficient for precise estimation, but this remains a limitation that future work with additional election cycles could address.

\paragraph{Limitations.} This proof of concept has several limitations that subsequent work should address. The analysis covers only four presidential elections and four House elections, and as the robustness analysis demonstrates, the pro-Democratic finding is leveraged by the 2020 fire season. The turnout measure (log total votes) is a crude proxy without a proper population denominator. County-level aggregation may mask within-county heterogeneity. And the negative within-$R^2$ values in some specifications suggest that the smoke variable alone explains limited within-county variation after absorbing fixed effects, underscoring that these are small effects on a noisy outcome.

\section{Conclusion}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Under county-and-year fixed effects, wildfire smoke exposure in the 30 days before an election is associated with a pro-Democratic shift in presidential voting, with effects strongest in the weeks immediately preceding the election. The 7-day temporal dynamics provide the most compelling evidence for a causal effect, as the recency pattern is difficult to explain with confounders. A more demanding specification with state-by-year fixed effects eliminates the effects (Appendix~\ref{sec:stateyear}), suggesting that within-state variation---concentrated in a few Western states in high-fire years---may be insufficient for precise estimation with only four elections. House elections show weaker and less consistent patterns. These preliminary results suggest that wildfire smoke---which is plausibly exogenous and affects a far larger population than fire proximity---offers a promising research design for studying how environmental experience shapes political behavior, but additional election cycles and sharper identification strategies are needed to establish causality.

\subsection{Exclusive 7-Day Windows}
\label{sec:exclusive_windows}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Figures~\ref{fig:excl_mean} and~\ref{fig:excl_frac} present the exclusive-window counterparts to the cumulative results in Figure~\ref{fig:windows}. In the exclusive specification, all thirteen non-overlapping 7-day bins are entered simultaneously as regressors. These estimates identify the marginal contribution of each week's smoke exposure holding all other weeks constant. The sign-flipping between adjacent bins reflects multicollinearity among temporally proximate smoke measures; the cumulative windows in the main text provide the more interpretable summary.

\subsection{Threshold Comparison}
\label{sec:thresholds}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Table~\ref{tab:thresholds} compares the fraction-above-threshold treatment variable at three cutoffs: 20~$\mu$g/m$^3$ (onset of visible haze, used in the main text), 35.5~$\mu$g/m$^3$ (EPA ``Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups''), and 55.5~$\mu$g/m$^3$ (EPA ``Unhealthy''). All specifications use the 30-day pre-election window with county and year fixed effects plus time-varying controls (Specification~3).

The haze threshold has substantially more variation (236 nonzero observations, 1.9\%) than the higher thresholds (47 and 19 nonzero, respectively). For Democratic vote share, all three thresholds produce significant positive estimates, with larger coefficients at higher thresholds---consistent with a dose-response relationship in which more severe smoke produces stronger pro-Democratic shifts. For incumbent vote share, the sign flips across thresholds: the haze measure shows a significant \textit{positive} effect (moderate smoke may benefit incumbents through rally effects), while the unhealthy measure shows a significant \textit{negative} effect (severe smoke punishes incumbents). This sign reversal is consistent with dual mechanisms operating at different exposure intensities. For turnout, only the haze threshold is significant, reflecting its greater statistical power.

\subsection{State-by-Year Fixed Effects}
\label{sec:stateyear}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

Table~\ref{tab:stateyear} presents estimates replacing year fixed effects with state-by-year fixed effects, so that identification comes only from within-state variation in smoke across counties within the same election. This is substantially more demanding than the state linear trends in Column~(4) of Table~\ref{tab:main}: state-by-year FE absorb \textit{all} state-level time variation, not just linear trends.

No coefficient is statistically significant in either the presidential or county House specifications. The presidential pro-Democratic effect shrinks from 0.00135 to essentially zero (0.00001), and the anti-incumbent effect is halved and loses significance. This pattern is consistent with state-level time-varying shocks---such as statewide political campaigns, ballot measures, or economic conditions---being correlated with smoke exposure and driving part of the baseline estimates.

Figure~\ref{fig:resid_map} provides visual context for these null results. After residualizing county-level smoke on state-by-year means, the remaining within-state variation is concentrated in a small number of Western states during high-fire years (especially 2020). With only four presidential elections, the effective identifying variation under state-by-year fixed effects may simply be too limited for precise estimation.

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:litreview}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

This appendix surveys the literatures most relevant to this paper, organized into five strands: environmental shocks and voting, the theory of anti-incumbent and retrospective voting, air pollution and political behavior, wildfire smoke and economic/health outcomes, and identification strategies using atmospheric variation.

\subsection{Environmental Shocks, Natural Disasters, and Voting}

A large literature examines whether environmental shocks alter political behavior. The findings cluster around two mechanisms: retrospective incumbent punishment and climate salience.

\subsubsection{Incumbent Punishment}

\citet{healy2010myopic} provide the foundational analysis of myopic retrospective voting in response to disasters. Voters punish incumbents for disaster damage but reward them for disaster relief spending, and the asymmetry implies that governments underinvest in preparedness relative to relief. \citet{achen2016democracy} extend the argument, contending that voters engage in ``blind retrospection,'' punishing incumbents for events entirely beyond governmental control, including droughts, floods, and famously, shark attacks---though the shark attack finding is contested by \citet{fowler2018sharks}. \citet{gasper2011make} show that voters punish governors and presidents differently after natural disasters depending on whether a disaster declaration was issued, suggesting voters can partly distinguish between experiencing harm and receiving a government response. \citet{bechtel2011lasting} study the 2002 Elbe River flood in Germany and find that voters rewarded the incumbent government for effective flood management, demonstrating that the sign of the disaster--voting relationship depends on the government's response. \citet{cole2012incumbency} use rainfall variation in India to show that voters reward governments for disaster relief, providing a developing-country parallel.

\subsubsection{Wildfires and Voting}

\citet{hazlett2020wildfire} is the most directly relevant paper. Using proximity to California wildfire perimeters, they find that fire proximity increases pro-environment ballot proposition voting, but only in already-Democratic areas. Republican areas show no response. My paper extends their work along three dimensions: smoke exposure rather than fire proximity provides a plausibly exogenous treatment; national scope replaces a California-only sample; and I find effects across the partisan spectrum. \citet{liao2022extreme} study how extreme weather and natural disasters affect campaign contributions and House elections, finding that natural disasters hurt incumbents with anti-environment records, providing complementary evidence using campaign finance data.

\subsubsection{Climate Salience}

\citet{herrnstadt2014weather} use Google search intensity to show that unusual weather increases searches for ``climate change'' and that members of Congress vote more pro-environment when their home states experience unusual weather---the clearest evidence for a salience channel linking environmental experience to political behavior. \citet{hoffmann2022climate} use panel data across Europe to show that personal experience of climate-related events raises environmental concerns and increases Green party voting. \citet{baccini2021salience} study Swiss referendum voting after floods and find that flood exposure increases support for pro-climate ballot measures by up to 20 percent. \citet{elliott2023climate} examine whether U.S.\ senators vote more pro-environment after climate-related natural disasters, finding effects that are short-lived (about two years), consistent with the temporal dynamics in my results showing strongest effects at shorter pre-election windows.

\subsubsection{Weather and Turnout}

\citet{gomez2007weather} show that rain on election day suppresses voter turnout with differential effects by party. This is relevant for the turnout channel: my positive turnout coefficient could be in tension with their finding if smoke operates like bad weather, but smoke exposure in my specification is measured over the pre-election window rather than on election day itself.

\subsection{Anti-Incumbent Voting: Theoretical Foundations}

The robust anti-incumbent finding places this paper within one of the oldest debates in democratic theory.

\subsubsection{Sanctioning and Selection Models}

The formal literature on electoral accountability begins with \citet{ferejohn1986incumbent}, who models elections as a sanctioning mechanism: voters retain the incumbent if performance exceeds some threshold and replace her otherwise. The key insight is that retrospective voting can sustain accountability even when voters are poorly informed about policy. \citet{ashworth2012electoral} reviews how modern formal models blend sanctioning with selection (voters using past performance to infer incumbent quality), noting that the empirical literature has struggled to separate the two mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Blind Retrospection and Its Critics}

\citet{achen2016democracy} argue that retrospective voting is often ``blind''---voters punish incumbents for events beyond governmental control. \citet{gasper2011make} push back, showing voters distinguish between harm and government response. \citet{fowler2018sharks} challenge the shark attack result specifically. The emerging consensus, as articulated in \citet{healy2013retrospective}, is a middle ground: voters are neither fully rational accountability agents nor purely blind avengers, but decision makers who sometimes apply coherent logic and sometimes fall prey to psychological biases.

\subsubsection{Psychological Mechanisms}

Three mechanisms are especially relevant. First, negative affect: \citet{healy2010substituting} show that irrelevant events (college football outcomes) shift incumbent evaluations, suggesting negative emotional states reduce support for the status quo regardless of source. \citet{huber2012sources} provide experimental confirmation that voters overweight recent performance and are influenced by irrelevant lotteries. Second, attribution: partisanship powerfully shapes blame assignment after disasters, which may partly explain the partisan heterogeneity I find. Third, issue salience: negative experiences can shift the issues voters weight, activating voters who already care about climate while others simply experience negative affect. This dual-channel interpretation---salience for the pro-Democratic shift, affect for the anti-incumbent shift---maps onto my results where both channels appear to operate simultaneously through different pathways.

\subsection{Air Pollution and Political Behavior}

\citet{bellani2024air} is the closest analogue for the pollution--voting mechanism. Using 60 German federal and state elections, they exploit within-county variation in PM\textsubscript{10} on election day to show that a 10~$\mu$g/m$^3$ increase reduces the incumbent vote share by two percentage points. They argue this operates through a subconscious emotional channel: PM\textsubscript{10} fluctuations are imperceptible, yet they increase negative emotions. My setting differs critically in that wildfire smoke is visible and salient, potentially activating both their affect channel and a deliberate salience channel. \citet{kahn2007voting} provides background for the heterogeneity pattern: areas with stronger baseline pro-environment preferences show larger smoke effects.

\subsection{Wildfire Smoke: Economic, Health, and Behavioral Effects}

A rapidly growing literature documents the broad consequences of wildfire smoke, establishing the health and mood channels that could mediate voting effects.

\subsubsection{Labor Markets and Economic Costs}

\citet{borgschulte2022air} is the leading paper using wildfire smoke as an exogenous source of PM\textsubscript{2.5} variation to study economic outcomes, estimating that each additional smoke day reduces quarterly per capita earnings by about 0.1 percent. Their identification strategy---relying on the quasi-random spatial dispersion of smoke plumes using the same NOAA HMS data underlying \citet{childs2022daily}---is closely related to mine. Importantly, they show that controlling flexibly for wind direction does not change their estimates, strengthening the case that smoke rather than correlated wind patterns drives the variation.

\subsubsection{Mental Health and Mood}

\citet{burke2021exposures} document behavioral and sentiment responses to wildfire smoke: during smoke events, people search more for air quality information, stay home more, and express more negative sentiment. This provides direct evidence for the mood mechanism I invoke for incumbent punishment. \citet{jung2025mental} isolate short-term mental health effects of wildfire-specific PM\textsubscript{2.5}, finding that a 10~$\mu$g/m$^3$ increase significantly increases emergency department visits for depression and anxiety, with effects lasting up to seven days. \citet{miller2024wildfire} estimate that wildfire smoke accounts for 18 percent of ambient PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentrations and 0.42 percent of deaths among adults 65 and older, establishing the health harm of the exact pollution source I study.

\subsection{Identification: Wind Direction and Atmospheric Dispersion}

\citet{deryugina2019mortality} pioneered using wind direction as an instrument for PM\textsubscript{2.5}, estimating effects of acute exposure on elderly mortality. The innovation is that the approach does not require knowing the location of pollution sources---it simply exploits the fact that wind direction shifts nonlocal pollution in and out of a county. My approach differs in that rather than using wind as an instrument for total PM\textsubscript{2.5}, I use data from \citet{childs2022daily} that has already separated wildfire smoke PM\textsubscript{2.5} from other sources, and argue that atmospheric dispersion is quasi-random conditional on county and year fixed effects. \citet{rangel2019agricultural} use upwind/downwind variation from agricultural fires in Brazil to study birth outcomes, a conceptually very close design. \citet{borgschulte2022air} demonstrate as a robustness check that controlling for wind direction does not change their smoke estimates, a test that could be applied in my setting as well.
