*Wildfire Smoke and Voting Behavior in the United States*

Prepared for David Clingingsmith • February 2026

Overview
========

This report surveys the literatures most relevant to your paper on
wildfire smoke and voting behavior. It is organized into five main
strands: (1) environmental shocks and voting, (2) the theory of
anti-incumbent and retrospective voting, (3) air pollution and political
behavior, (4) wildfire smoke and economic/health outcomes, and (5)
identification strategies using wind and atmospheric variation. For each
strand, I summarize the key papers, highlight what they find, and note
how they connect to your contribution.

1. Environmental Shocks, Natural Disasters, and Voting
======================================================

A large literature examines whether environmental shocks---floods,
hurricanes, droughts, wildfires---alter political behavior. The findings
cluster around two mechanisms: retrospective incumbent punishment and
climate salience.

1.1 Incumbent Punishment and Retrospective Voting
-------------------------------------------------

> **Healy and Malhotra (2010)** *(American Political Science Review).*
> Foundational paper on myopic retrospective voting. Voters punish
> incumbents for disaster damage but reward them for disaster relief
> spending. The asymmetry implies that governments underinvest in
> preparedness relative to relief. Your anti-incumbent finding is
> squarely in this tradition.
>
> **Achen and Bartels (2016)** *(Democracy for Realists (Princeton
> UP)).* Influential argument that voters engage in "blind
> retrospection," punishing incumbents for events beyond their control,
> including droughts, floods, and even shark attacks. The shark attack
> finding is contested (Fowler and Hall 2018), but the broader
> framework---that negative experiences shift votes against the
> incumbent regardless of policy responsibility---directly supports your
> incumbent punishment results.
>
> **Gasper and Reeves (2011)** *(American Journal of Political

> **Bechtel and Hainmueller (2011)** *(American Political Science
> Review).* Study of the 2002 Elbe River flood in Germany. Voters
> rewarded the incumbent government for effective flood management.
> Demonstrates that the sign of the disaster--voting relationship

>
> **Cole, Healy, and Werker (2012)** *(Journal of Development

1.2 Wildfires and Voting
------------------------

> **Hazlett and Mildenberger (2020)** *(American Political Science
> Review).* The most directly relevant paper to yours. Uses proximity to
> California wildfire perimeters to study effects on pro-environment
> ballot proposition voting. Find that fire proximity increases
> pro-environment voting, but only in already-Democratic areas.
> Republican areas show no response. Your paper extends this in three
> important ways: (1) smoke exposure rather than fire proximity,
> providing a plausibly exogenous treatment; (2) national scope rather
> than California only; (3) effects across the partisan spectrum, not
> limited to Democratic areas. The contrast between their null
> Republican finding and your positive (if smaller) Republican-area
> effect is worth emphasizing.
>
> **Liao and Ruiz Junco (2022)** *(Journal of Environmental Economics
> and Management).* Study how extreme weather and natural disasters
> affect campaign contributions and U.S. House elections. Find that
> temperature shocks motivate Democratic donations and that natural
> disasters hurt incumbents with anti-environment records. Provides
> complementary evidence on the electoral consequences of environmental
> experiences, using campaign finance data that captures revealed rather
> than stated preferences.

1.3 Climate Salience and Voting
-------------------------------

> **Herrnstadt and Muehlegger (2014)** *(Journal of Environmental
> Economics and Management).* Use Google search intensity as a proxy for
> climate change salience and show that unusual weather increases
> searches for "climate change" and "global warming." Crucially, they
> also show that members of Congress vote more pro-environment when
> their home states experience unusual weather. This is the clearest
> evidence for a salience channel linking environmental experience to
> political behavior.
>
> **Hoffmann, Muttarak, Peisker, and Stanig (2022)** *(Nature Climate
> Change).* Using panel data across Europe, show that personal
> experience of climate-related events raises environmental concerns and
> increases Green party voting. Provides cross-national evidence that
> the salience mechanism operates across institutional contexts.
>
> **Baccini and Leemann (2021)** *(Political Science Research and
> Methods).* Study Swiss referendum voting after floods and find that
> flood exposure increases support for pro-climate ballot measures by up
> to 20%. The referendum setting is useful because it isolates policy
> preferences from candidate preferences.
>
> **Elliott, Nguyen-Tien, Strobl, and Tveit (2023)** *(Journal of the
> Association of Environmental and Resource Economists).* Examine
> whether U.S. senators vote more pro-environment after climate-related
> natural disasters in their states. Find that support for environmental
> legislation increases after unusual human losses (but not economic
> losses), and that the effect is short-lived (about two years). The
> temporal dynamics in your paper---strongest effects at 30--60
> days---are consistent with their finding of rapid decay.
>
> **Holub and Schündeln (2023) and Garside and Zhai (2022)** *(Working
> papers).* Study the 2021 German floods and subsequent election using
> municipality-level data. Find surprisingly small effects despite
> extreme salience of the event, which a recent paper by Fremerey et al.
> (2025) attributes to differential out-migration from flood-affected
> areas.

1.4 Weather and Turnout
-----------------------

> **Gomez, Hansford, and Krause (2007)** *(Journal of Politics).*
> Classic paper showing that rain on election day suppresses voter
> turnout, with differential effects by party. You cite this as one of
> three strands your paper bridges. Important for the turnout channel:
> your positive turnout coefficient could be in tension with their
> finding if smoke operates like bad weather, but smoke exposure is
> pre-election (over 60 days) rather than on election day.

2. Anti-Incumbent Voting: Theoretical Foundations
=================================================

Your paper's robust anti-incumbent finding places it squarely within one
of the oldest and most important debates in democratic theory: what does
it mean when voters punish the party in power? This section reviews the
theoretical literature on retrospective voting, which provides the
conceptual framework for interpreting your results.

2.1 The Sanctioning Model
-------------------------

The formal literature on electoral accountability begins with Barro
(1973) and Ferejohn (1986), who model elections as a mechanism for
disciplining incumbents. In Ferejohn's canonical model, voters cannot
trust campaign promises and are unable to distinguish between candidates
ex ante. Instead, they adopt a retrospective voting rule: retain the
incumbent if performance exceeds some threshold, and replace her
otherwise. This transforms elections from a selection mechanism
(choosing the best candidate) into a sanctioning mechanism (punishing
poor performance). In equilibrium, the threat of electoral punishment
disciplines the incumbent to exert effort she would otherwise shirk. The
key insight is that retrospective voting can sustain accountability even
when voters are poorly informed about policy, as long as they can
observe outcomes. This "sanctioning" interpretation of anti-incumbent
voting is optimistic about democracy: voters do not need to understand
the details of governance; they just need to know whether they are
better or worse off.

2.2 The Selection Model
-----------------------

Fearon (1999) challenged the pure sanctioning interpretation by arguing
that forward-looking voters should care not just about disciplining the
current incumbent but about selecting a better replacement. In a
selection model, voters use past performance as a signal of competence
or type. Poor outcomes lead voters to update negatively about the
incumbent's ability and to prefer the challenger, whose type is drawn
from the prior. The selection and sanctioning interpretations generate
different predictions. Under sanctioning, voters punish incumbents to
create incentives; under selection, they replace incumbents they believe
are low-quality. Both predict anti-incumbent voting after bad outcomes,
but for different reasons. Ashworth (2012) provides a comprehensive
review showing that most modern formal models blend the two mechanisms,
and the empirical literature has struggled to separate them.

2.3 Blind Retrospection and Its Critics
---------------------------------------

The most provocative challenge to the accountability interpretation
comes from Achen and Bartels (2016), who argue that retrospective voting
is often "blind": voters punish incumbents for events entirely beyond
the government's control. Their evidence includes electoral responses to
droughts, floods, and famously, shark attacks off the New Jersey coast
in 1916. If voters cannot distinguish between bad outcomes caused by
poor governance and bad outcomes caused by bad luck, retrospective
voting loses its disciplining function and becomes, in V.O. Key's early
phrase, "blindly striking a blow at a scapegoat."

This interpretation has generated substantial pushback. Gasper and
Reeves (2011) find that voters do distinguish between the disaster
itself and the government's response, punishing incumbents primarily
when disaster declarations are not issued. Healy and Malhotra (2010)
show that voters reward relief spending but not preparedness spending,
suggesting something more nuanced than blind punishment---voters
evaluate observable government responses, even if they weight them
suboptimally. Fowler and Hall (2018) challenge the shark attack result
specifically, arguing that it does not replicate with alternative
specifications. The emerging consensus, as articulated in Healy and
Malhotra's (2013) review in the Annual Review of Political Science, is a
middle ground: voters are neither fully rational accountability agents
nor purely blind avengers. They resemble decision makers in other
domains---sometimes applying a coherent logic, sometimes falling prey to
well-known psychological biases such as end-period weighting, mood
effects, and attribution errors.

2.4 Psychological Mechanisms: Mood, Attribution, and Salience
-------------------------------------------------------------

A more recent literature has explored the psychological channels through
which negative experiences translate into anti-incumbent votes, moving
beyond the question of whether retrospective voting is rational to ask
how it actually works. Three mechanisms are especially relevant to your
paper.

First, negative affect or mood: Healy, Malhotra, and Mo (2010, PNAS)
show that irrelevant events---specifically, the outcomes of college
football games on the weekend before an election---shift evaluations of
incumbents. This suggests that negative emotional states, regardless of
their source, reduce support for the status quo. Huber, Hill, and Lenz
(2012, APSR) provide experimental evidence that voters overweight recent
performance and are influenced by irrelevant lotteries, confirming that
mood contamination is a robust phenomenon. This is the channel
emphasized by Bellani et al. (2024) for imperceptible air pollution:
PM10 worsens mood, and bad mood punishes incumbents.

Second, attribution: voters may consciously attribute blame for negative
experiences, even when the causal connection to government is tenuous.
Malhotra and Kuo (2008) study blame attribution after Hurricane Katrina,
finding that partisanship powerfully shapes who voters hold responsible.
This suggests your partisan heterogeneity finding---stronger effects in
Democratic counties---may partly reflect differential attribution of
blame for wildfire smoke to Republican incumbents or differential
connection of smoke to climate policy.

Third, issue salience: negative experiences can shift the issues voters
weight when making their choice. If smoke makes environmental quality
salient at the moment of voting or in the weeks before, voters who
already care about climate are activated (explaining the Democratic
county effect) while other voters simply experience negative affect
(explaining the cross-partisan incumbent punishment). This dual-channel
interpretation---salience for the pro-Democratic shift, affect for the
anti-incumbent shift---maps cleanly onto the theoretical distinction
between rational updating and blind retrospection.

2.5 Implications for Your Paper
-------------------------------

Your paper's findings speak directly to this theoretical debate. The
anti-incumbent effect that survives dropping 2020 is consistent with
either the affect channel (smoke makes people feel bad, and they punish
whoever is in charge) or a rational response to perceived government
failure to address air quality. The pro-Democratic effect that is driven
primarily by 2020 is more consistent with the salience channel: the
extreme 2020 fire season made climate an impossible-to-ignore issue,
activating pro-environment voting especially where such preferences were
already latent. The fact that both channels appear to operate
simultaneously in your data is itself a contribution to the theoretical
literature. Most prior work treats blind retrospection and rational
accountability as competing interpretations; your setting, where smoke
is both an involuntary mood-altering experience and a visible,
attributable environmental event, suggests that both mechanisms can
operate on the same electorate at the same time through different
pathways.

3. Air Pollution and Political Behavior
=======================================

A newer strand of research examines how ambient air pollution---distinct
from discrete disaster events---affects voting. This is the literature
your paper most directly contributes to.

4. Wildfire Smoke: Economic, Health, and Behavioral Effects
===========================================================

A rapidly growing literature documents the broad consequences of
wildfire smoke. This matters for your paper because it establishes both
the health/mood channels and the behavioral responses that could mediate
voting effects.

4.1 Labor Markets and Economic Costs
------------------------------------

> **Borgschulte, Molitor, and Zou (2022)** *(Review of Economics and
> Statistics).* The leading paper using wildfire smoke as an exogenous
> source of PM2.5 variation to study economic outcomes. Using satellite
> smoke plume data (the same NOAA HMS plumes underlying the Childs et

> smoke reduces quarterly per capita earnings by about 0.1%, implying
> annual labor market losses of \$125 billion. Effects are larger for
> older workers and in counties with more Black residents. Their
> identification strategy is very close to yours: they rely on the

> of ambient PM2.5 concentrations and 0.42% of deaths among adults 65+.
> Relevant because it establishes the health harm of the exact same
> pollution source you study, supporting the negative-affect mechanism.

4.2 Mental Health and Mood
--------------------------

> **Burke, Heft-Neal, Li, et al. (2022)** *(Nature Human Behaviour).*
> Document behavioral and sentiment responses to wildfire smoke using
> cell phone data, social media, private pollution sensors, and internet
> search activity. Key finding: during smoke events, people search more

> PM2.5 (not total PM2.5). Using California data from the extreme 2020
> fire season, find that a 10 μg/m³ increase in wildfire PM2.5
> significantly increases emergency department visits for depression,
> anxiety, and mood disorders, with effects lasting up to seven days.

> among clinical populations.

4.3 Other Behavioral Effects

5. Identification: Wind Direction and Atmospheric Dispersion
============================================================

Your identification strategy relies on the quasi-random atmospheric
dispersion of wildfire smoke. Several important papers use related
strategies for causal inference in environmental economics.

6. Positioning Your Contribution
================================

Your paper sits at the intersection of these four literatures. Here is
how it relates to each:

Relative to the environmental shocks and voting literature (Hazlett and
Mildenberger 2020; Healy and Malhotra 2010), your innovation is the
treatment variable: smoke exposure rather than fire proximity or
disaster declarations. Smoke is plausibly exogenous, affects far more
people, and isolates the experiential/health channel from property
destruction.

Relative to the air pollution and voting literature (Bellani et al.
2024), your setting differs in that wildfire smoke is visible and
salient. This means both the affect channel (smoke makes people feel
bad) and the salience channel (smoke makes climate change tangible) can
operate simultaneously. The fact that your pro-Democratic effect is
fragile but the anti-incumbent effect is robust may help disentangle
these: salience shifts votes toward Democrats, while affect punishes the
incumbent regardless of party.

Relative to the wildfire smoke economics literature (Borgschulte et al.
2022; Miller et al. 2024), you provide the first evidence that smoke
affects political behavior, not just health and labor markets. This is a
meaningful extension because it shows that the welfare costs of smoke
include democratic consequences.

Relative to the identification literature (Deryugina et al. 2019), your
use of source-separated smoke PM2.5 from Childs et al. (2022) is both a
strength and a simplification. You avoid the need for an instrument
because the data already isolates the exogenous component, but this
means your identification rests on the quality of the Childs et al.
machine learning separation rather than on an exclusion restriction.
Citing Borgschulte et al.'s wind-direction robustness check and
replicating it could address this.

7. Perceptual Thresholds: When Is Smoke Noticeable?
===================================================

A key distinction between your paper and Bellani et al. (2024) is that
wildfire smoke is perceptible to people---they can see it, smell it, and
feel its irritating effects---whereas day-to-day fluctuations in ambient
PM10 are not. This matters theoretically because it determines which
mechanisms can operate: if pollution is imperceptible, only the
subconscious affect channel is available; if it is salient, both affect
and deliberate salience/attribution channels can operate. Understanding
the PM2.5 thresholds at which smoke becomes perceptible to humans helps
contextualize your treatment variable and the magnitudes you report.

7.1 Visual Perception: Haze and Reduced Visibility
--------------------------------------------------

PM2.5 is the main driver of reduced visibility (haze) in the United
States (EPA). The relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and visual
range is well established, particularly for wildfire smoke. O'Neill,
Lahm, Fitch, and Broughton (2013, Journal of the Air & Waste Management
Association) derive the empirical relationship PM2.5 = 622 ×
VR\^(−0.98), where VR is visual range in kilometers, with a correlation
of 0.99. This relationship was originally calibrated from co-located
PM2.5 monitors and airport visibility observations in Helena, Montana
during heavy smoke events.

The practical visibility thresholds used by U.S. public health agencies
for wildfire smoke (from the EPA's Wildfire Smoke: A Guide for Public
Health Officials) are approximately as follows. When visual range
exceeds about 12--15 miles (roughly 20--25 km), air quality is
classified as "good," corresponding to 1--3 hour PM2.5 below about 38
μg/m³. When visual range drops to 5--11 miles (8--18 km), air quality is
"moderate" (PM2.5 roughly 39--88 μg/m³). Below 5 miles (\~8 km),
conditions are classified as "unhealthy for sensitive groups" or worse,
and below 1--3 miles, conditions are "very unhealthy" to "hazardous."

This means that haze becomes noticeable to most people at PM2.5
concentrations somewhere in the range of 20--40 μg/m³, depending on
background conditions and humidity. In arid western environments where
baseline visibility is very high, haze from smoke can be perceptible at
even lower concentrations. For context, your sample mean smoke PM2.5 is
2.7 μg/m³ over the 60-day pre-election window, and the extreme 2020
Western fire season produced means around 40 μg/m³. This implies that at
the sample mean, smoke would not be visually obvious as haze, but that
counties with above-average exposure---particularly in the right tail of
the distribution---would experience clearly visible smoke.

7.2 Olfactory Perception: Smell
-------------------------------

The smell of wildfire smoke operates through a different channel than
the particulate matter itself. Smoke odor comes primarily from volatile
organic compounds (VOCs)---not from PM2.5 particles, which are too small
to trigger olfactory receptors. The key VOCs in wildfire smoke include
acrolein, formaldehyde, benzene, and various phenolic compounds. Because
VOCs and PM2.5 are co-emitted but have different atmospheric lifetimes
and dispersion characteristics, the relationship between PM2.5
concentration and perceptible odor is imperfect.

There are no well-established PM2.5 thresholds at which wildfire smoke
becomes reliably detectable by smell. Several features of the problem
make this difficult to pin down. First, VOCs and PM2.5 disperse and
decay at different rates---smoke can lose its characteristic smell
within about a day of travel while PM2.5 persists longer. This means
that smoke transported long distances may still elevate PM2.5 without
being smellable. Atmospheric scientist Jeff Pierce of Colorado State
University has noted that in the Northeast United States, wildfire smoke
transported from Canada or the West often does not smell like smoke,
because the odor-causing VOCs have dissipated during transport, even
though PM2.5 concentrations remain elevated. Washington State's
occupational safety agency explicitly warns that "wildfire smoke can be
harmful even when it can't be seen or smelled."

Second, olfactory sensitivity varies enormously across individuals, with
factors including age, smoking status, and sex all affecting detection
thresholds. Third, olfactory adaptation (habituation) occurs
rapidly---people exposed to smoke for extended periods may stop noticing
the smell even as concentrations remain high.

That said, during acute smoke events where PM2.5 is elevated to levels
in the "unhealthy" range (roughly 55+ μg/m³ for 24-hour averages, higher
for short-term peaks), smoke odor is typically quite obvious to most
people, particularly if the smoke is relatively fresh (originating
within a few hundred miles). At these levels, people also commonly
report eye, nose, and throat irritation---physical symptoms that make
the smoke experience highly salient regardless of whether they can
identify the smell.

7.3 Implications for Your Paper
-------------------------------

The perceptual thresholds have several implications for interpreting
your results:

First, your treatment variable is a 60-day mean. Even if daily peaks
produced visible haze or detectable odor, averaging over 60 days will
dilute this. A mean smoke PM2.5 of 2.7 μg/m³ could reflect many clean
days plus a few smoky episodes, or persistent low-level smoke. The
temporal dynamics results (Figure 1) showing larger effects at shorter
windows are consistent with the idea that acute, perceptible smoke
events drive the political response.

Second, the distinction between Bellani et al.'s invisible PM10 and your
visible/smellable smoke is important for mechanism. If your effects
operated only through subconscious mood changes (as in Bellani et al.),
we would not necessarily expect the pro-Democratic salience effect. The
fact that you find both a pro-Democratic shift (salience) and incumbent
punishment (affect) is consistent with smoke being perceptible enough to
activate deliberate climate-related reasoning in addition to mood
effects.

Third, the finding that your pro-Democratic effect is driven by the 2020
fire season---when smoke levels were extreme and highly
perceptible---while the anti-incumbent effect is robust even without
2020, suggests that the salience channel may require perceptible smoke
(high concentrations) while the affect channel operates at lower,
possibly imperceptible levels. This is an interesting distinction you
could develop further.

Fourth, you might consider a specification that interacts smoke exposure
with an indicator for whether daily smoke PM2.5 exceeded a
perceptibility threshold (say, 20--35 μg/m³ on any given day in the
pre-election window), to test whether the number of "perceptible smoke
days" predicts voting differently than average smoke PM2.5. This could
help disentangle the salience and affect channels.

Fifth, and relatedly, an alternative treatment variable worth
considering is the share of days in the pre-election window in which
daily smoke PM2.5 exceeded a health-relevant threshold. The EPA's
24-hour PM2.5 standard is 35 μg/m³, and AQI breakpoints classify daily
PM2.5 above 35.5 μg/m³ as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" (AQI
101--150) and above 55.5 μg/m³ as "Unhealthy" for everyone (AQI
151--200). Computing the fraction of days in the 30- or 60-day
pre-election window that exceeded one of these thresholds has several
advantages over mean smoke PM2.5. It is more directly interpretable as a
measure of salient exposure: a county where 10 of 60 days had unhealthy
air is more meaningfully "smoke-affected" than one where mild background
smoke was persistent but imperceptible. It also reduces sensitivity to
the extreme right tail of the daily distribution, which can distort the
mean and generate leverage for individual observations. Since the Childs
et al. (2022) data provide daily county-level smoke PM2.5, computing
this measure is straightforward. You could estimate specifications using
the share of days above 35 μg/m³ (a threshold where haze is visible and
many people experience symptoms) or above 55 μg/m³ (where smoke is
unmistakable and nearly everyone is aware of it). If the pro-Democratic
effect is driven by salience while the anti-incumbent effect operates
through mood, the share-of-unhealthy-days measure should predict the
Democratic vote share more strongly than mean PM2.5, while the mean
might be a better predictor of incumbent punishment. This would provide
a clean test of the dual-mechanism interpretation you propose in the
discussion.
